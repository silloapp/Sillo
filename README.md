# Sillo

Sillo aims to help connect people in an organization through anonymous question asking and plan-making, in order to help break down awkward social barriers, dispel misleading first-impressions, and more effectively facilitate bonding between members. The idea was extensively user-tested through a mid-fidelity prototype over the spring 2020 semester, and received an overall positive reception from the Berkeley campus community.
